ANALYSIS:-

 1- This is supervised mechine learning classifier, we are classifing a mail or text as spam or legitimate by calculating the probability of all keywords which are present in mail and according to this calculation(probability).

2 - Blocking 1 legitimate message is as bad as letting 100s spam messages to pass.
          
     if n1 is of spam massege treated as spam.
     if n2 is of spam massege treated as legitimate.
     if n3 is of legitimate massege treated as spam.
      

 then we define two terms :-
       1- spam recall(sr) = n1/n1+n2
       2- spam precision(sp) = n1/n1+n3






 LIMITATION:- This classifier is good for only those mail in which all present keywords are independent.
              In case of dependent keywords calculated probability will not be correct. This complication arises  
              due to the ambiguity in English Language.
