USED FILES:-
            1- Classifer.py(source code / implimentation code)
            2- UCI Database(text files for testing )
            3- Keyword.text(a file contating keywords)


                                                      wb

 ** wb- used for making link between code(classifer.py) and used Database(uci) ;[by locating the path of database]

 ** ws- by the help of active function database is connected;[ an inbuilt function present in openpyxl module]
  

MATHEMATICAL CALCULATION USED :-
1- Probability of every keyword when it is treated as ham(legitimate) means if this keyword is present in a mail then what is probability that this is not a spam keyword.
   
2- Probability of every keyword when it is treated as spam( not legitimate) means if this keyword is present in a mail then what is probability that this is a spam keyword.

3- Total probability of keywords whether they are present in spam or ham. 

4- Baysien analyasis if a particular kayword present in the text(mail) is comming from spam or ham.

5 - We classify a message as spam or legimitate according to the calculated probability(by baye's theoram).
